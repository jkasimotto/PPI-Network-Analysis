Our collaboration hub for network analysis in the Math3888 project.

Each team member has a notebook with access to a shared library of useful functions and datasets.

Every dataset will usually have a .detail.txt, .global.csv and .local.csv file. The detail file is for 
a plain english description of the dataset. The global csv file describes the global properties 
(e.g. network #nodes is_connected diameter) while the local csv file describes the local properties
(e.g. node1 degree dist betweeness_centrality)
