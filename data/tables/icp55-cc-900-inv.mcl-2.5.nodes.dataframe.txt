- pim1_shell: the shortest_path_length to pim1
- betweeness:
- eigenvector:
- closeness:
- bridging:
- cluster_id:
- cluster_size
- cluster_degree: the degree of the protein within the cluster
- cluster_eigenvector:
- cluster_closenss:
- cluster
- min-shell: min(icp55_shell, pim1_shell)
- betweeness/min-shell:
